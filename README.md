This project uses a compute shader in Unity to render a 3D graph made up of geometric shapes. Each cube in the graph is positioned on the GPU based on mathematical functions like waves, ripples, and spheres. I wrote an HLSL shader to color the cubes based on their position, which adds depth and variation across the surface.

For the fractal system, I used Unityâ€™s Job System to handle updates across a large recursive structure. This let me animate complex transformations like rotation and sway without tanking performance. I also added color variation using another HLSL shader, so the fractal would look more organic and less uniform.
